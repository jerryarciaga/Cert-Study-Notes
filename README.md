# How to use my notes
I create these notes using an application called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Personally, this note-taking application works best for me as all I need is markdown support and to keep everything organized. Just install Obsidian, clone this repository and open the folder as a vault and you will be good to go.

I plan to keep this updated as I study for certifications.
